{-| Represent a stream with a thunk. Streams let you efficiently and lazily
transform values. Streams flatten operations like [`map`](#map) and
[`filter`](#filter) so you don't have to iterate through a stream multiple
times like a list.

    Stream.range 1 1000
        |> Stream.map (\n -> n * 2)
        |> Stream.filter (\n -> n > 10)
        |> Stream.take 3
        |> Stream.toList == [12, 14, 16]

You can use streams with lists of data too.

    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        |> Stream.fromList
        |> Stream.map (\n -> 2 ^ n)
        |> Stream.filter (\n -> n > 8)
        |> Stream.toList == [16, 32]
